# addon-examples

Here are some examples of add-ons that can be loaded by a modeler capable of interpreting them (e.g: [Graphite](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/GraphiteThree)). This shows you how to create a new add-on using [ultimaille](https://github.com/ultimaille) and the library that exposes the program's interface to a modeler.

## Add an add-on into graphite

You can add these add-ons following this documentation: https://github.com/ultimaille/graphite-addon-loader
